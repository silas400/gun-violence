<p>390,000 students faced school gun violence since 1999.</p>
</div>
<div class="back">
<p>Since the Columbine shooting in 1999, more than 390,000 U.S. students have been exposed to gun violence at school. In 2022 alone, over 43,000 children faced gunfire on school grounds, showing both the long-term impact and the alarming scale of recent years.</p>

<p>2021 had the most school shootings recorded.</p>
</div>
<div class="back">
<p>The 2021–22 school year had more shootings than any other since tracking began in 2000. This shows school violence reached its highest level in over 20 years. The increase highlights the growing danger students face on campus. It also points to the need for stronger prevention and safety measures.</p>

<p>The U.S. has far more school shootings than other nations.</p>
</div>
<div class="back">
<p>Research shows the U.S. has had 57 times as many school shootings as all other major industrialized countries combined. Guns are also the leading cause of death for American children and teens, with youth being many times more likely to be killed by firearms compared to peers in other wealthy nations. These risks disproportionately harm Black and Latinx children, and exposure to such violence often leads to depression, PTSD, substance abuse, and school failure.</p>

<p>Nearly all mass shooters are male.</p>
</div>
<div class="back">
<p>From 1966 to 2021, research shows that 98% of mass shooting perpetrators identified as male. This overwhelming gender imbalance highlights how masculinity, social pressures, and access to firearms intersect in these violent acts. Understanding the role of gender is key to developing more effective prevention strategies and addressing the cultural factors that contribute to mass violence.</p>

<p>Research shows that many school shooters faced serious stressors like abuse, academic pressure, or failed relationships, and most displayed signs of mental health concerns. These struggles often appeared well before violence occurred, highlighting the need for early support and prevention.</p>

<p>Most under-18 shooters get guns from their home.</p>

<p>About 4.6 million U.S. children live in homes with at least one loaded, unlocked gun. Since the vast majority of school shooters under 18 access firearms from their household, secure storage and child-access prevention (CAP) laws are critical. Safe storage could stop many tragedies before they begin.</p>

<h1>Prevention Strategies</h1>
</div>
<div class="flashcard-container" style="display: none;">
<div class="flashcard">
<div class="front">
<p>Positive school climate reduces violence.</p>
</div>
<div class="back">
<p>Schools that actively prevent bullying, harassment, and discrimination create safer and more welcoming environments. When students feel respected and supported by peers and staff, they are less likely to engage in aggression. This sense of safety not only reduces violence but also boosts attendance, motivation, and academic outcomes.</p>

</div>
<div class="flashcard">
<div class="front">
<p>Storage laws can be effective.</p>
</div>
<div class="back">
<p>Nearly three-quarters of school shooters under 18 got their guns from home or a relative’s home. With over 4 million children living in houses where firearms are left loaded and unlocked, the danger is real. Secure storage and CAP laws stop kids from getting easy access to guns, making them one of the most effective ways to prevent school shootings before they happen.</p>

<div class="flashcard">
<div class="front">
<p>Threat assessment teams could reduce school shootings.</p>
</div>
<div class="back">
<p>Unlike lockdown drills, which only prepare students to survive an attack, threat assessment teams proactively identify and respond to warning signs. These multidisciplinary groups help distinguish real threats from false alarms and support students in crisis, lowering suspensions, expulsions, and arrests. By intervening early, threat assessment could potentially stop a tragedy before it becomes a mass shooting.</p>

<div class="flashcard">
<div class="front">
<p>Mental health staffing prevents violence.</p>
</div>
<div class="back">
<p>Adequate counselors, psychologists, and social workers play a vital role in identifying and supporting struggling students before problems escalate into crises. Mental health staff provide early intervention, coping strategies, and safe outlets for stress. Research shows that access to these services reduces risks of violence and improves long-term student well-being.</p>

</div>
<div class="flashcard">
<div class="front">
<p>Discipline reform and coordination save lives.</p>
</div>
<div class="back">
<p>Harsh suspensions and zero-tolerance policies often push students further toward disengagement and anger, while supportive discipline helps redirect behavior in healthier ways. At the same time, effective communication across schools, law enforcement, and mental health professionals allows early warning signs to be acted on before tragedy occurs. Together, these practices create safer school systems and stronger community trust.</p>

<p>Gun violence impacts not just students but also the teachers and staff who guide them daily.

<div class="front">
<p>Armed officers don’t reduce casualties.</p>
</div>
<div class="back">
<p>A study of 133 school shootings from 1980–2019 found that schools with an armed officer on scene had nearly three times more deaths compared to those without one. The presence of guards showed no reduction in injuries, and researchers noted that many shooters, often suicidal, may even be encouraged rather than deterred by armed resistance. Prevention and early intervention efforts are more effective than relying on armed guards.</p>

<div class="front">
<p>There is no single profile of a school shooter.</p>
</div>
<div class="back">
<p>Research shows school shooters come from diverse demographics, family backgrounds, and academic levels. Some are socially isolated while others are well connected, making prediction by profile unreliable. This underscores the importance of focusing on behaviors and warning signs rather than stereotypes.</p>

<p>School Resource Officers don’t reduce shootings.</p>
</div>
<div class="back">
<p>School Resource Officers (SROs) are sworn law enforcement officers placed in schools to provide security and build relationships with students. Research shows SROs fail to lower deaths or injuries in shootings. Instead, their presence increases suspensions, expulsions, arrests, absenteeism, and even lowers graduation rates. These harms fall hardest on Black, Indigenous, Latinx students, and students with disabilities, underscoring the need for strict limits on SRO roles and mandatory training.</p>
